## Abstract

In the age of data-driven research, the University of Mannheim Research Data Center (DFZ) at the Mannheim University Library bundles together services for researchers interested in research data management. In this talk we will introduce the audience to the FDZ’s core services such as guidelines for Data Management Plans or the data collection via OCR, provide information about its data resources such as the Aktienführer data archive, and (re-)introduce the newest addition to the FDZ: The German Internet Panel data collection infrastructure. In addition, this talk will provide an overview of the University Libraries activity within the BERD@NFDI consortium. The second part of the talk will deal with the NFDI consortium BERD@NFDI which is coordinated by the University Library. BERD@NFDI focuses on the research data management and analysis of unstructured data in Business, Economics and related fields, such as unstructured text from social media, news, images etc. We will present the services under development and how researchers can profit from BERD@NFDI.
